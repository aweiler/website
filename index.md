I work on theoretical high-energy physics and I am currently mainly interested in the theoretical implications of the results from the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva. The experiments at CERN (ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb) will allow us to learn more about the fundamental forces of nature. In particular, I hope to find out if some of our theoretical ideas of the last thirty years were correct or even better if a new understanding will have to emerge. 

Graduate Students: Matthias Schlaffer, Maikel de Vries
